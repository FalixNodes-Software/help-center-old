# Optimizing your Server
Optimizing your server is a great idea to reduce lag and server load, as it increases the efficiency of the server, letting it process requests quickly. By doing this, you will also increase TPS.

## Pre-requisites
Choosing the right server type is very important. An example of a good server software type is [Purpur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/), as it is very optimized and provides a ton of configuration options.

## How do I optimize my Server?
You can find a detailed guide [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/) for PaperMC, or you can use [this one](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization) for Purpur or other PaperMC forks.
These guides give a detailed explanation of all the settings they do on your server. To use them, go to the said files and configure them as the guide shows.

You also have a shortcut. You can check out premade configs by clicking [here](https://github.com/flaxeneel2/pterodactyl-optimized-paper-egg) and then edit the values to your liking (PaperMC).

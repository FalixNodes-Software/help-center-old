# Error Code: 137
While playing on your server, it can suddenly shut down and crash with error code 137.

## What does this error mean?
This error indicates that your server is using too much CPU to the point of overloading. The server automatically turns off to prevent overload of the whole node.

## How can I solve this?
There are several ways to fix this.

### Expand resources
You can expand your resources (Cores and RAM) for your server to run less loaded. You're able to buy them from the store located in the [client panel](https://client.falixnodes.net). These resources are bought with Falixcoins (if you don't know how to get them, please visit this [article](https://help.falixnodes.net/falix/general/getting-coins)).

### Optimize server
You can also try optimizing your server (if you don't know how, please visit this [article](#)).

### Upgrade Plan
You may consider buying the **upgrade** too. It allows you access to better nodes with better hardware and without restrictions (your server won't stop if it uses too much CPU). It costs 500 FalixCoins (the first time) and then 200 FalixCoins/month. For more information, visit this [page](https://client.falixnodes.net/upgrade).

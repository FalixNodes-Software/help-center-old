<h2 id="getting-a-plugin">Getting a plugin</h2>
<p>So my plugin I have chosen to install is Vault, Vault is permission, chat, and economy API. It is mainly used alongside Essentials. So that&#39;s what I will install today. You can download many plugins from <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/categories/spigot.4/">Spigot</a> or <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins">Bukkit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installing-it-on-your-server">Installing it on your server</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: <strong><em>Every time you edit your files we recommend you turn off your server as sometimes not stoping your server can break things. Keeping your server on while editing files is bad because when you go to save and restart, all that work will get overwritten back to what it previously was. Even <code>/reload</code> can break other plugins such as DiscordSRV or Essentials.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To start, <strong>make sure your server is offline</strong> as we are messing with files. If you do leave your server on, when the server saves, it may overwrite everything causing you to lose the files you just put in.</p>
<p>Ok now, to install it on your server you are going to want to open your File Manager and go into a folder called plugins. All you have to do is drag in the <code>.jar</code> file. It should look something like this.

<p>Next, start your server.</p>
<p>You have now just installed a plugin!</p>
<h2 id="configuring-plugins">Configuring plugins</h2>
<p>Most plugins have a config file to edit, so you can set the plugin&#39;s settings.</p>
<p>To access the config file, go inside the <code>plugins</code> folder, and look for another folder that should have been created. The folder is called the plugin name, open the file inside called <code>config.yml</code>.</p>
<p>You are now inside the config. Vault&#39;s config is simple but yours may not be. There are usually notes written by the creator about each kind of setting. Edit as you please.</p>
<p>When you are all set, just save the config and start up your server!</p>
<h2 id="deleting-plugins">Deleting plugins</h2>
<p>To delete a plugin, you need to delete the <code>.jar</code> file. You can also delete the folder with the config if you would like. But it is not required.</p>
<h2 id="turning-off-a-plugin">Turning off a plugin</h2>
<p>Now you may not want to have to delete a <code>.jar</code> plugin because you might just need to turn it off for a little, or you just don&#39;t want to go through the hassle of deleting and reinstalling. Well, you can turn it off. Once again, since we are messing with files make sure to <strong>turn off your server</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, go to the location of your jar file. You are going to want to rename the extension (the . part of the file ex <code>.jar</code>) to <code>.jaroff.</code> It should look like the photo below:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6vTQ46N/image.png" alt="JarOff"></p>
<p>We rename the extension because .jaroff is not a real file extension so Minecraft won&#39;t read it, thus it won&#39;t start the plugin.</p>
<p>Last but not least, start the server!</p>
<h2 id="turning-back-on-the-plugin">Turning back on the plugin</h2>
<p>Turning back on the plugin is pretty simple. Change the <code>.jaroff</code> extension back to <code>.jar</code> extension. Then start your server back up!</p>
